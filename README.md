# XQ

[JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) reimplemented purely in Rust.

## Caution
This program is under development. You probably want to use the original implementation of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/), or pure Go implementation of it called [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq/) built by [itchyny](https://github.com/itchyny) instead.


## Acknowledgements
- Although this isn't a direct translation at all, I referred to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) built by [ Stephen Dolan](https://github.com/stedolan) and [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq/) built by [itchyny](https://github.com/itchyny). Thank you for the interesting product!
